## How to fix Wasp could not start its dev database: `Port 5432 is already in use.`

tl;dr: use `docker ps` to see what containers are running and then use `docker stop <container_name>` to stop the container.

```bash
user@computer42:~/saas/app$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE      COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                         NAMES
a68d82db8f03   postgres   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   8 minutes ago   Up 7 minutes   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp, [::]:5432->5432/tcp   wasp-dev-db-OpenSaaS-2471a659a5
user@computer42:~/saas/app$ docker stop wasp-dev-db-OpenSaaS-2471a659a5
```

now run

```bash
user@computer42:~/saas/app$ wasp start db
```

```bash
