## Log

### Step 1

I use the plastic scraper to get in between the case as it's a pull apartsnap together. A little bit of damage wasinevitable

### Step 1.5

You can see the insidefor reference

Opening up the case I can immediately see that the belt has disintegrated

### Step 4

replace the belt

I didn't wanna pay $10 to have a belt kit shipped so I just used two rubber bands.
