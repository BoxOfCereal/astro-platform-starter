### teardown

### Outer Case removal

I think that all I need to do is take the black case offand there are eight screws. I used a 6T star bit to remove the screws.

Now that all of the screws are removed, The top can easily be removed bypulling the lip on the front of the case up and off.

Using needle nose pliers, Carefully disconnect the three ribbon cablesbypulling up on either sideof the push connector.

Now unscrewthe 4smallerPhilip's head screws that are on either side of either side of the MIDI portsand then unscrew thelarger Phillips head screws on the other side. Either way you decide to take the screws off the board will fall free.
