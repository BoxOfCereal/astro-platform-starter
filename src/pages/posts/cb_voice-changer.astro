        <h2>Experience Notes</h2>
        <p>The very first one I cracked openand probed I immediately broke. lol /</p>

        <h2>Problems</h2>

        <h3>Problem 1</h3>
        <p>
            There are two problemsthatneed to be addressed for this to be successfulI need to have6.35 MMM jacks one for the mic and one for thespeaker and I
            need to be able to switch this on and leave this onI don't need that but I would I would like that
        </p>

        <h3>Problem 2: dead speaker</h3>
        <p>The second problem I run into is thatspeakersthat come with the machine are dead.</p>

        <p>
            I double checked to make sure I wired the TRS jackcorrectly. So on the pins that are supposed to go to the speaker I put alligator clips and went to
            another speaker. And I got sound from all of the effects. I mentioned this because I have another unit where only one effect works.
        </p>
