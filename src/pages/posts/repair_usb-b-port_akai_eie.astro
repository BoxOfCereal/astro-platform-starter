        <p class="mb-6">
            I normally would not try something for the first time on a necessary and somewhat costly piece of equipment. I've also had it for probably 10 years
            so there's some sentimental value. But the port crapped out and I need the audio interface for practice. And if that weren't enough reasons I really
            don't wanna buy a new one.

                There are eight screws for the case, but only the top four need to be removed. (I figured that out after) I used a 6T star bit to remove the
                screws.

        <p>Now let's carefully desolder the six points of the connector.</p>

        <StepFigure
            src={akai_eie_10}
            alt="Close-up of the underside of the broken port"

                Close-up of the solder points that need to be desoldered. There are six in total - four for the mounting tabs and two for the data connections.
            </p>
        </StepFigure>

        <p>My soldering iron was not able to heat up enough to desolder the large joints, so I bought a new one and replaced it.</p>

        <p>Now it's time to take a desoldering pump, heat up the solder on the board, and remove it.</p>

        <p>
            <strong>Q:</strong> What is the ideal temperature to set the soldering iron to desolder and remove the joints?<br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            <a href="https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/right-soldering-temperature/"> Right soldering temperature guide </a>
            — somewhere between 200°C and 400°C (392°F–752°F). It's best to experiment within this range.
        </p>

        <p>I'm going to set my soldering iron to <strong>644°C</strong>.</p>
        <small>Tip: Scotch tape makes a great heat sink.</small>

        <StepFigure src={akai_eie_13} alt="Desoldered port" title="Desoldering Process" titleLevel="h4" stepNumber={10} width={imageWidth} height={imageHeight}>
            <p>After applying heat and using a desoldering pump, the old port should come free. Be patient and work carefully.</p>

                This was very difficult and took me several days. After removing most of the solder with a pump, I had to heat each individual pin and wiggle
                the broken USB port free. I ended up destroying the original port in the process — which I don't recommend.
            </p>
        </details>

        <p>I've put the board back in but won't put the cover on yet in case the repair failed — I don't want to unscrew everything again.</p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>

        <p>
            In this blog post, we tore down the Akai EIE and repaired the USB type B female port. We ran into some issues getting the old port off but
            successfully replaced it with a new one.
