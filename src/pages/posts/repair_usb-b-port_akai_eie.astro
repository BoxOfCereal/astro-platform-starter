    <h1>Repair USB B Female Port AKAI EIE</h1>

    <p>This is a repair log for repairing the USB type B female port located on the back of the interface.</p>

    <h2>Rationale</h2>
    <p>
        With the difficulty of a job like this on a crucial piece of equipment for my setup, I normally would not do this. But I have no other option and need
        this interface in 16 days from this date. I would really strongly prefer not to purchase something else, so I bought USB type B female USB connectors
        from Amazon. Here's the one I bought:

    </p>

    <h2>Difficulty</h2>
    <p>Medium</p>

    <h2>Components</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><input type="checkbox" checked disabled /> AKAI EIE</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><input type="checkbox" checked disabled /> Phillips #2 Screwdriver</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" checked disabled /> 6T Star Bit</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" checked disabled /> Soldering Iron</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" checked disabled /> Desoldering Pump</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" checked disabled /> Needle Nose Pliers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Log</h2>

    <h3>Before</h3>
    <p>I like to take pictures of what I'm working with for reference. Unlike software, you can't easily see an exact previous state of the repair process.</p>

    <h3>Teardown</h3>

    <h4>Outer Case Removal</h4>
    <p>I think that all I need to do is take the black case off â€” there are eight screws. I used a 6T star bit to remove the screws.</p>

    <img src={akai_eie_2.src} alt="Screw bit used" />
    <img src={akai_eie_3.src} alt="Case with one screw removed" />
    <img src={akai_eie_4.src} alt="Case with all screws removed" />

    <p>Now that all of the screws are removed, the top can easily be removed by pulling the lip on the front of the case up and off.</p>

    <img src={akai_eie_5.src} alt="Case with the top removed" />

    <p>Using needle nose pliers, carefully disconnect the three ribbon cables by pulling up on either side of the push connector.</p>

    <p>
        Now unscrew the 4 smaller Phillips head screws that are on either side of the MIDI ports and then unscrew the larger Phillips head screws on the other
        side. Either way, once all screws are removed, the board will fall free.
    </p>

    <h3>Replacement</h3>

    <p>Now let's carefully desolder the six points of the connector.</p>
    <img src="/assets/fixed/akai-eie/voice_changer_16.jpg" alt="Close-up of the underside of the broken port" />

    <p>My soldering iron was not able to heat up enough to desolder the large joints, so I bought a new one and replaced it.</p>

    <p>Now it's time to take a desoldering pump, heat up the solder on the board, and remove it.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> What is the ideal temperature to set the soldering iron to desolder and remove the joints?<br />
        <strong>A:</strong>
        <a href="https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/right-soldering-temperature/"> Right soldering temperature guide </a>
        â€” somewhere between 200Â°C and 400Â°C (392Â°Fâ€“752Â°F). Itâ€™s best to experiment within this range.
    </p>

    <p>I'm going to set my soldering iron to <strong>644Â°C</strong>.</p>
    <small>Tip: Scotch tape makes a great heat sink.</small>

        <p>
            This was very difficult and took me several days. After removing most of the solder with a pump, I had to heat each individual pin and wiggle the
            broken USB port free. I ended up destroying the original port in the process â€” which I donâ€™t recommend.
        </p>
    </details>

    <p>Iâ€™ve put the board back in but wonâ€™t put the cover on yet in case the repair failed â€” I donâ€™t want to unscrew everything again.</p>

    <p><strong>Success!</strong></p>

    <p>
        ASIO is reading my interface just like before.<br />
        Phew!
    </p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        In this blog post, we tore down the Akai EIE and repaired the USB type B female port. We ran into some issues getting the old port off but successfully
        replaced it with a new one.
