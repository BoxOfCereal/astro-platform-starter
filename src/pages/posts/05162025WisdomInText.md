# Wisdom in Text

## TLDR

I want to know how I can identify how much wisdom a piece of text contains.

## My thoughts

I don't think this is the same as how much noise or semantic content is in a document.

A video where someone does something and they teach you some of the intuitions and the insights that they have from doing it; that contains wisdom.

A piece of text like a tutorial guiding you through a code implementation; that contains wisdom.

**Noise** can be anything from advertisements to unclear wording to drifting away from the main point;the thing that the text is trying to teach.
