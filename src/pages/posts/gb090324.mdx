## Intro

I got this lil' piano from my friend (Who also happens to be a member of (Red Shift Andromeda)[https://redshiftandromeda.com/]).

<hr />

## Features

It's cute, feels more solid than it should be, and has a couple interesting features.

<div className="flex justify-center my-4">

    alt="GB090324" 
    width={400}
    className="max-w-full h-auto rounded-lg shadow-xl"
  />
</div>



### Features
- 3 Drum samples
- 3 Instrument samples
- 3 Drumloop samples
- 1 music loop
- 3 step volume control
- kill switch

But the most interesting one is a _record_ and _playback_ that seems to be able to record The sequence of Key presses for a bar and play it back.

### Quirks

#### Out of tune!

When I press the `C` key my tuner reads a detuned `B`. And when I press `C#` I get `C`, but it is out of tune by about `36 cents`.


#### Idle Jingle

If left alone for a while, the piano will play a Jingle and cut power to the speaker.


## Tear down

### Removal of the case
Removal of the case is easy enough.There's at least six or so screws in the back.

<div className="flex justify-center my-4">

    width={400}
    className="max-w-full h-auto rounded-lg shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### Close up of the circuit board
Close up of where the buttons make contact with the circuit board.

    className="max-w-full h-auto rounded-lg shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### Circuit Bending

I tried for a couple days to really get some interesting sounds off this simple board. I got some interestingresults but they weren't repeatable 😔. 

If you notice the black dot on the board, that's where the main chip and any memory is stored. If that weren't there we would have been able to probably get more interesting results.


<details summary="Summary" className="text-white">
  <summary style="display: none;">Can we remove the dot?</summary>
  <p>Short story: Yes but</p>
  <p>Long story: It is More difficult and potentially breaking than I want to deal with.</p>
</details>

  />
</div>


## The Mods
### Feedback
I added two switches that will introduce feedback at different frequencies based off which combination is pressed. Unfortunately it's extremely quiet in relation to the notes and other sounds.

    width={400}
    className="max-w-full h-auto rounded-lg shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### Jack Output
I also added the standard switch connector jack output so it can beinterfaced with amps and mixers etc.

  />
</div>

## Finished 
It's complete!

  />
</div>

## The sounds

### Great for metalcore
It sounds like a littlebit of Nintendo grind :)

## Final thoughts
I spent extra time on this becausemy friend gave it to me so I wanted to try as hard as I could To get something really interesting. But, after 4 or 5 sessions of probing and testing I thought I needed to put a close on the project.

I'm happyI received it and it's going to be a good memento! I hope I can use the recording Functionality in an upcoming project!
