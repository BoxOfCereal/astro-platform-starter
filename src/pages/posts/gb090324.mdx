## Intro

I got this piano from my Very thoughtful friend (Who also happens to be a very talented musician with which I am in (Red Shift Andromeda)[https://redshiftandromeda.com/] with.).

<hr />

It's cute, feels more solid than it should be, and has a couple interesting features.

## Features

<div className="flex justify-center my-4">
  <Image 
    src={image11} 
    alt="GB090324" 
    width={400}
    className="max-w-full h-auto rounded-lg shadow-xl"
  />
</div>




- 3 Drum samples
- 3 Instrument samples
- 3 Drumloop samples
- 1 music loop
- 3 step volume control
- kill switch

But the most interesting one is a _record_ and _playback_ that seems to be able to record The sequence of Key presses for a bar and play it back.

## Tear down

### Removal of the case
Removal of the case is easy enough.There's at least six or so screws in the back.

<div className="flex justify-center my-4">

    width={400}
    className="max-w-full h-auto rounded-lg shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### Close up of the circuit board
Close up of where the buttons make contact with the circuit board.

<div className="flex justify-center my-4">

    alt="GB090324" 
    width={400}
    className="max-w-full h-auto rounded-lg shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### Circuit Bending
I tried for a couple days to really getsome interesting sounds off this simple little board.I got something interesting but it was not repeatable after I solderedcontacts and switches on. 

<div className="flex justify-center my-4">
  <Image 
    src={image6} 
    alt="GB090324" 
    width={400}
    className="max-w-full h-auto rounded-lg shadow-xl"
  />
</div>


## The Mods
### Feedback
I added two switches that will introduce feedbackat different frequencies based off which combination is pressed. Unfortunately it's extremely quiet and relation To the notes and other sounds in the keyboard.

<div className="flex justify-center my-4">
  <Image 
    src={image7} 
    alt="GB090324" 
    width={400}
    className="max-w-full h-auto rounded-lg shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

<div className="flex justify-center my-4">
  <Image 
    src={image8} 
    alt="GB090324" 
    width={400}
    className="max-w-full h-auto rounded-lg shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### Jack Output
I also added the standard switch connector jack output so it can beinterfaced with amps and mixers etc.

<div className="flex justify-center my-4">
  <Image 
    src={image9} 
    alt="GB090324" 
    width={400}
    className="max-w-full h-auto rounded-lg shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## Finished 
It's complete!

<div className="flex justify-center my-4">
  <Image 
    src={image10} 
    alt="GB090324" 
    width={400}
    className="max-w-full h-auto rounded-lg shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## Final thoughts
I spent extra time on this becausemy friend gave it to me so I wanted to try as hard as I could To get something really interesting. But, after 4 or 5 sessions of probing and testing I thought I needed to put a close on the project.

I'm happyI received it and it's going to be a good memento! I hope I can use the recording Functionality in an upcoming project!
